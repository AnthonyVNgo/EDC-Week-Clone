# EDC-Week-Clone
A clone of EDC Week's webpage built with Vue 3 and Tailwind CSS. 
<br><br>
## Why I Built This
When I interviewed for Aptive Education, the CTO shared that the company uses a completely different tech stack from what I learned at my bootcamp (Vue instead of React). I wanted to get a better understanding of Vue's ecosystem, so I decided to combine my interest of music festivals and EDM with Vue fundamentals, along with some styling from Tailwind CSS, to create this clone project. 

While the company relies on Options API, I wanted to stay up-to-date, which is why I've included both Options API along with Composition API and the use of script setup.
